# Fun Project - Architecture

## Overview

The application is a simple console-based Java application that uses Apache Commons CLI for command-line processing and
SLF4J for logging.

## Structure

The application is divided into three main classes:

- `Main`: This class is the entry point of the application. It handles command-line argument parsing and starts
  the `KeepAliveTimer` if requested.

- `KeepAliveTimer`: This class implements `Runnable` and contains the logic for moving the mouse pointer around the
  screen. It takes an end time as an argument and continues the mouse movement until that time.

- `SigntureSelector`: This calls implements the logic to randomly select a Signature from the repository and also copy
  the same to clipboard for easy access.

The application uses a `Robot` object from `java.awt` to handle the mouse movement. The screen resolution is determined
using the `GraphicsDevice` and `DisplayMode` classes, also from `java.awt`.

Unit tests are provided using JUnit 5 and Mockito, with code coverage reports generated by the JaCoCo Maven plugin.
