# Fun Project - Architecture

## Overview

The application is a simple console-based Java application that uses Apache Commons CLI for command-line processing and SLF4J for logging.

## Structure

The application is divided into two main classes:

- `Main`: This class is the entry point of the application. It handles command-line argument parsing and starts the `KeepAliveTimer` if requested.

- `KeepAliveTimer`: This class implements `Runnable` and contains the logic for moving the mouse pointer around the screen. It takes an end time as an argument and continues the mouse movement until that time.

The application uses a `Robot` object from `java.awt` to handle the mouse movement. The screen resolution is determined using the `GraphicsDevice` and `DisplayMode` classes, also from `java.awt`.

Unit tests are provided using JUnit 5 and Mockito, with code coverage reports generated by the JaCoCo Maven plugin.
