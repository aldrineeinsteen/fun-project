## End Time

Use `-e` or `--end-time` followed by the time in HH:mm format to set the end time for the program. For
example, `-e 18:00` sets the end time to 6pm.

## Keep Alive

Use `-k` or `--keep-alive` to keep the system active by moving the mouse pointer around the screen. If this option is
not provided, the program will simply wait until the end time and won't do anything.
